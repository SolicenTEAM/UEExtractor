# Solicen.UEExtractor

[**Englsih**](/README.md) | [**Русский**](./docs/ru/README.ru.md)

Thanks original author `Ambi` for his script and idea to research. <br>
Made with ❤️ for **all** translators and translation developers.

This a script/tool to extract `LocresCSV` from unpacked directory from the **`.pak` or (`.utoc`|`.ucas`)** archive format from the [Unreal Enigne](https://www.unrealengine.com/). 

With it, you will receive a `LocresCSV` file for localization of the game based on its resources. However, `LocresCSV` is not a special format, and this name is only used to separate from the regular CSV file, which it is anyway.

## LocresCSV Structure:
Will be imported or converted to `.locres` file.
- key = hash (A string of 32 characters) 
- source = decodedString
- Translation = (Null from unpacked resources)
```
# UnrealEngine .locres asset
key,source,Translation

# Extracted with UEExtractor & Solicen Translation Tool
```

## Using:
* Or [download](https://github.com/SolicenTEAM/UEExtractor/releases) and **drag & drop** folder to a command tool to parse directory and get `<dir_name>.csv`.
* Or use `UEExtractor.exe` in command line to parse directory.

### UEExtractor - Unreal Engine (Text) Extractor
